## üìñ About This Project

The [OWASP AIVSS v0.5 report](https://aivss.owasp.org/assets/publications/AIVSS%20Scoring%20System%20For%20OWASP%20Agentic%20AI%20Core%20Security%20Risks%20v0.5.pdf) provides a groundbreaking framework for quantifying the unique security risks posed by autonomous AI systems. While the paper and its original calculator are excellent for understanding the core logic, a gap existed for an all-in-one, professional tool that could handle the entire assessment workflow from start to finish.

This project was built to bridge that gap.

The AIVSS Dynamic Risk Assessment Dashboard is more than a calculator‚Äîit's a complete workbench for security analysts, AI developers, and technical leaders. It transforms the theoretical framework from the PDF into a practical, interactive tool designed to make assessing and communicating agentic AI risk intuitive, efficient, and authoritative.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This dashboard goes far beyond a simple calculator by integrating a suite of professional features:

- **üìä Full CVSS v4.0 Calculator:** A complete, NIST-compliant CVSS v4.0 calculator is built directly into the dashboard. There is no need for external tools; perform the entire vulnerability assessment from start to finish in one place.

- **üìà Dynamic Risk Visualization:** Don't just see a number, see the _shape_ of the risk. The dashboard generates a real-time **AARS Radar Chart** and a **Score Contribution Bar Chart** to help you instantly understand the source and nature of the agent's risk profile.

- **ü§î "What-If" Scenario & Profile Management:** Save your complete assessments as named profiles (e.g., "Baseline Risk," "Mitigated - Tool Use Limited"). This transforms the tool into a strategic modeling dashboard, allowing you to measure the impact of security controls and make data-driven decisions.

- **üöÄ Side-by-Side Comparison View:** Select any two of your saved profiles to render their scores and visualizations side-by-side. Instantly see the percentage reduction in risk from your proposed mitigations, making it easy to justify security investments.

- **üìÑ One-Click Professional PDF Reporting:** Generate a comprehensive, multi-page PDF report of your current assessment with a single click. The report includes an executive summary, scores, the full vector string, and all visualizations, solving the critical problem of documenting and sharing your findings.

## üß† Scoring Methodology

This tool is a faithful and compliant implementation of the **primary AIVSS-Agentic formula** detailed on **Page 54** of the official v0.5 report.

The final score is calculated using a transparent, 50/50 average between traditional and agentic risk:

- **CVSS Base Score:** Calculated automatically using the integrated CVSS v4.0 calculator, powered by the official `pandatix/js-cvss` library to ensure perfect compliance.
- **AARS (Agentic AI Risk Score):** Calculated as a direct sum of the 10 official AARS factors, each rated as None (0.0), Partial (0.5), or Full (1.0).
- **Threat Multiplier:** An adjustable modifier based on the CVSS v4.0 "Exploit Maturity" supplemental metric.

## üöÄ How to Use the Dashboard

This tool is designed to be an intuitive part of your security workflow.

1.  **Define the Vulnerability:** In the first column, use the **CVSS v4.0 Base Metrics** toggles to describe the traditional vulnerability. The CVSS Base score will update in real-time.
2.  **Define the Agent:** Use the **AARS Factors Assessment** toggles to rate each of the 10 agentic capabilities. The AARS score will update instantly.
3.  **Analyze the Results:** The center and right columns will display the final AIVSS score and all visualizations, giving you a complete picture of the risk.
4.  **Model & Compare:** In the center column, use the **Scenario Profiles** card to save your assessment. Create a second profile where you model a security control (e.g., changing an AARS factor from "Full" to "Partial"). Use the "Compare" buttons to see both profiles side-by-side at the bottom of the page.
5.  **Export Your Findings:** Once your analysis is complete, click the **"Generate Report"** button in the header to download a professional PDF of your current assessment.
